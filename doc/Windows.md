1) Create an IMG file with the sources:

make windows-image

The resulting windows-image.img file can be passed to a Windows-based HVM and build there.

2) Create an ISO containing built drivers and installer:

make windows-image-extract installer-vanir-os-windows-tools

The resulting vanir-windows.iso can be attached to a Windows HVM in order to install
the Vanir PV drivers.
